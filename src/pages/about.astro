        Hello, my name is Shaneel Kumar and I am a Full Stack Web Developer! I have recently
        graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa and I am excited to get into the industry to make
        a difference.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-2xl text-left">
        I am driven by my need to create consistently, whether it's web
        development, or making music, or throwing together a dish with whatever's left in the fridge!
        Creativity and curiosity are core values to me and I am always learning new skills to
        take my work to the next level.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-2xl text-left">
        I first learnt to code as a student so that I could create complex geometries and new design 
        tools. I grew this skillset further during my architectural thesis, creating a tool for architects 
        to simulate a demographic and use the mapped data to inform their design.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-2xl text-left">
        I've since explored learning Python and web development in my spare time. These explorations led to me
        eventually becoming more interested in web development and that is why I chose to attend a bootcamp to change careers.
        I think web development is an incredibly creative field and I am excited to learn more so that I can 
        build the things that I've always wanted to and to create experiences that intersect between cutting edge 
        development and design.
