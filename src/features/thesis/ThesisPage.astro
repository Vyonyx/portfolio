        My architectural thesis focuses on creating a tool/methodology to help
        designers simulate the behaviour of a demographic and use the resulting
        visual feedback to inform their spatial planning and design.

      <p class={paragraphStyling}>
        The primary challenge is how we can assign behaviour to particles.
        Behaviour is qualitative and must be translated to quantitative measures
        through abstraction. I chose to use attraction and repulsion between
        different types of particles (demographics) and artefacts in an
        environment. I would consider this a bottom-up approach that leads to
        unpredictable results that we simply cannot plan for. Conway's "Game of
        Life" is a mathematical example that shows just how complex interactions
        can get, even with primitive behaviours.

      <p class={paragraphStyling}>
        This phase of the thesis tested how to apply behaviour to particles and
        how to map interactions. Dense clusters occurred within areas of
        overlap, highlighting areas suited for commercial and mixed-use. The
        interactions were mapped using particle tails, showing where the
        particle had travelled over time. The mapped geometry can then be used
        by designers to understand how to optimise spatial design through visual
        feedback.

      <p class={paragraphStyling}>
        I chose to use the refined methodology for the final phase of my thesis.
        I chose a section of Mumbai, India for my redesign and simulated the
        various people and existing environment to understand how I could best
        plan my redesign. The mapped data was used to manually place geometry
        into the scene based on density and oberserable patterns, leading to my
        final solution. I chose to use abstract geometries to take the emphasis
        away from the architectural design, and instead highlight the method and
        it's potential for spatial planning.
